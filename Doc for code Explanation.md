# Automated Web Application Deployment with AWS Boto3

## Overview
This document outlines the process and implementation for automatically managing the lifecycle of a web application hosted on AWS EC2 instances. It includes monitoring application health, reacting to changes in traffic, and scaling resources dynamically. Administrators are notified of infrastructure events through Amazon SNS.

---

## Objectives
- Deploy a web application on EC2 instances and configure it with a web server.
- Integrate an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic.
- Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for scaling based on traffic metrics.
- Send notifications for health and scaling events via SNS.
- Automate the deployment, update, and teardown of the infrastructure.

## Steps

### 1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Check if the S3 bucket exists using `boto3`.
2. If it does not exist, create a new S3 bucket in the specified AWS region.

### 2. **Launch an EC2 Instance with Nginx**
1. Launch an EC2 instance using a specified Amazon ubunbtu AMI.
2. Install Nginx on the instance and configure it to serve a static web page.

### 3. **Set Up an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
1. Create an Application Load Balancer in the specified subnets.
2. Assign a security group to the ALB for network traffic control.

### 4. **Create a Target Group**
1. Create a target group to manage the EC2 instances associated with the ALB.
2. Configure health checks to monitor instance availability.

### 5. **Register EC2 Instances with the ALB**
1. Register the launched EC2 instance with the target group.
2. Associate the target group with the ALB.

### 6. **Setup Auto Scaling Group (Optional)**
1. Create an Auto Scaling Group with the EC2 launch configuration.
2. Define scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization or traffic.

### 7. **SNS Notifications (Optional)**
1. Set up an SNS topic for alerts.
2. Subscribe administrators to receive email or SMS notifications.

## Deployment Workflow
1. **S3 Bucket Creation**: Ensure the bucket exists for storing application files.
2. **EC2 Instance Launch**: Deploy the instance with Nginx pre-installed and configured.
3. **ALB Setup**: Create and configure an Application Load Balancer to handle traffic.
4. **Target Group Creation**: Set up a target group to associate EC2 instances with the ALB.
5. **Instance Registration**: Register the EC2 instance with the ALB via the target group.
6. **Auto Scaling (Optional)**: Configure dynamic scaling policies to handle traffic changes.
7. **SNS Alerts (Optional)**: Enable notifications for health and scaling events.

## Additional Enhancements
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Temporarily store uploads on EC2 and transfer them to S3 for long-term storage.
- **Lambda Integration**: Use Lambda functions to automate monitoring and advanced notifications.

## Conclusion
This process ensures a scalable and automated solution for deploying and managing a web application on AWS. By integrating ALB, ASG, and SNS, the system achieves reliability and responsiveness to dynamic workloads. For further improvements, consider using additional AWS services like CloudWatch and Lambda for monitoring and automation.
